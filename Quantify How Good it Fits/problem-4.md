# Problem statement
is this line unique?


# Solution

No, the line $C^\ast$ that minimizes the sum $S$ is not necessarily unique. If there are two or more medians of the $y_i'$ values, then there are two or more candidate $y$-intercepts for the line $C$ in the rotated coordinate system, and hence two or more candidate lines $C^\ast$ in the original coordinate system.

For example, if the $y_i'$ values are evenly spaced, then there will be multiple medians, and hence multiple candidate lines $C^\ast$. In general, if there are $k$ distinct $y_i'$ values, then there will be $k$ candidate medians, and hence $k$ candidate lines $C^\ast$.
