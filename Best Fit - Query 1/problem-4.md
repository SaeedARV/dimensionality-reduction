# Problem statement

Show that every vector on line $C$ is of the form $∑_{i=1}^n t_i b_i$ where $b_i \in B$ and $t_i \in F$.

# Solution

In last problem we made a basis for this space and the definition of space includes this fact that for each $c \in C$ then $\exists t_1, t_2, ..., t_n$ that $c = ∑_{i=1}^n t_i b_i$.
