# Problem statement

Find a basis $B$ for the projective space $C$.

*Hypotheses:* $C$ *is an arbitrary line which is defined as* $C = \alpha x$ *and* $D'$ *is a dataset which is centered at the origin* $O(0, 0)$. *And V is a finite dimensional space over field K. And we know that* $C$ *is a subspace of* $V$ *containing* $D'$.

# Solution

For constructing the basis $B$ for this projective space $C$, we make our base for every $K_j$ solely.

$$B = \{ B_1, B_2, ..., B_N \} $$

which every $B_j$ is

$$B_j = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & \cdots & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ 

which $j$ th entry is 1.
