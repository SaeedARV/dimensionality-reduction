# Problem statement

Find a basis $B$ for the projective space $C$.

*Hypotheses:* $C$ *is an arbitrary line which is defined as* $C = \alpha x$ *and* $D'$ *is a dataset which is centered at the origin* $O(0, 0)$. *And V is a finite dimensional space over field K. And we know that* $C$ *is a subspace of* $V$ *containing* $D'$.

# Solution

For constructing the basis $B$ for this projective space $C$, we use the fact that every point $V$ in it is $\alpha * X% so we can guess that $X$ is enough for the basis of this projective space $C$.
