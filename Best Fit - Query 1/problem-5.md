# Problem statement

Find a basis for $V$.

# Solution

For all $X \in V$ we can say that $X = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ and it is equal to $(x_1 * (1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0)) + (x_2 * (0, 1, 0, \cdots, 0)) + \cdots + (x_n * (0, 0, \cdots, 0, 1))$ and that makes our basis which is $B =$ { $(1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0), (0, 1, 0, \cdots, 0), \cdots, (0, 0, \cdots, 0, 1)$ }.
