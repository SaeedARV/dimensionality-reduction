# Problem statement
Is $T$ an isomorphism?

# Solution

To determine whether $T$ is an isomorphism, we need to verify whether $T$ is bijective. That is, we need to show that $T$ is both injective and surjective.

From the previous steps, we know that $T(X_{\bar{n}}) = \mathbf{0}$, where $\mathbf{0}$ is the origin, and that all other points in the dataset $D'$ are positioned respectively. Thus, $T$ is not surjective, since not all points in $V$ are mapped to by $T$.

Furthermore, we can see that $ker(T) = {X_{\bar{n}}}$, since $T(X_{\bar{n}}) = \mathbf{0}$ and $T(\mathbf{x}) \neq \mathbf{0}$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in V \setminus {X_{\bar{n}}}$. Therefore, $T$ is not injective, since there exists a nonzero vector in $ker(T)$.

Since $T$ is neither injective nor surjective, it is not an isomorphism.
