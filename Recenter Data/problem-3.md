# Problem statement
Find a Homomorphism $\(T : V \rightarrow V\)$ such that $T(\bar{X}n) = O(0, 0)$ and all other points are positioned respectively.
Call the relocated dataset \(D'\).

*Hypotheses: We have the information that* $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ *is the center coordinate, and we are aware of the method to shift it.*

# Solution

It is evident that the problem requires us to use the homomorphism to relocate the dataset. To relocate a dataset D to a new dataset D' using a homomorphism $\(T : V \rightarrow V\)$, where $T(\bar{X}n) = O(0, 0)$ and all other points are positioned accordingly, we follow these steps:

1. Let's say we have a dataset called D, with points represented as (x, y) and we already found center coordinates $(\bar{x}), (\bar{y})$.

2. Now, we can define a homomorphism T that will transform the dataset D to D'. The transformation is as follows:

   For each point (x, y) in D, we subtract the average coordinates $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ from the original coordinates to get the new coordinates $(x', y')$:

   $$x' = x - \bar{x}$$
   
   $$y' = y - \bar{y}$$

   This transformation will reposition all points relative to the center coordinates.

3. Additionally, we can say that the center coordinate $\bar{X}n$ is the origin $(0, 0)$ in the new dataset D'.
