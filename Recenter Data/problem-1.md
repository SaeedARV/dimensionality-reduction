# Problem statement
Find the center of the data $\bar{X}n$.
# Solution

To find the center of a dataset with dim equal to 2, we should calculate the mean of the coordinates. The center represents the average position of all the data points in the dataset.

1. Let $n$ be the total number of data points in the dataset.
2. Let $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the x and y coordinates of the $i$-th data point, respectively.
3. Calculate the mean x-coordinate, $\bar{x}$, using the formula:

   $$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$

4. Similarly, calculate the mean y-coordinate, $\bar{y}$, using the formula:

   $$\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$$

The center of the data is represented by the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$.
