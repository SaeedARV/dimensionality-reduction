# Problem statement
Is Î± a Homomorphism?

# Solution: 

Yes, the isomorphism $\alpha$ defined in the previous problem is a homomorphism as well. This is because:

$\alpha$ is a mapping between two vector spaces $V$ and $K^n$,
$\alpha$ is linear, i.e. it satisfies the property:

$\alpha(av + bw) = a\alpha(v) + b\alpha(w)$
for any scalars $a,b$ and vectors $v,w \in V$.

$\ker(\alpha) = {0}$ (as shown in the previous problem), so $\alpha$ is injective.

$\alpha$ is surjective onto $K^n$ by construction.

Therefore, $\alpha$ satisfies all the requirements of a vector space isomorphism, and in particular is a homomorphism.
