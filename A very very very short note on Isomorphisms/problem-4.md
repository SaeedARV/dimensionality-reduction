# Problem statement
What can one say about Isomorphisms, studying only the properties of kernels?

# Solution
if $\alpha: V \rightarrow W$ is a linear transformation between two vector spaces $V$ and $W$ such that $\text{ker}(\alpha) = {0}$ and $\text{dim}(V) = \text{dim}(W)$, then $\alpha$ is an isomorphism. This is known as the rank-nullity theorem.

Therefore, if we know that the kernel of a linear transformation is trivial and the dimensions of the vector spaces involved are the same, we can conclude that the linear transformation is an isomorphism. Conversely, if we know that a linear transformation is an isomorphism, we can conclude that its kernel is trivial and its domain and codomain have the same dimension.
